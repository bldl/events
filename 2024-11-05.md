## Abstracts of the talks

## Green computing, a programming language perspective (M. Haveraaen)

Computing is using an increasing amount of the world's electricity production. The phrase "green computing"
refers to the efficient use of computing resources in order to reduce electricity consumption.
The most obvious steps to greener computing is using better algorithms and more efficient libraries. Simultaneously,
hardware is becoming more efficient, i.e., providing more computations per watt. Newer architectures, such as multicore CPUs,
soon approaching one million cores on a single chip, GPUs with their massive parallelism, TPUs and a stream of more experimental
architectures. Green programming implies adapting code to hardware, e.g., multilevel cache sizes, reduction of data movement in lieu of
replicated computing, adapting communication patterns to hardware connectivity, etc. In programming language design there are two trends:
(1) extend the language with new constructs allowing control of the new hardware features or (2) provide support for higher level abstractions
that hardware aware compilers can exploit. In this presentation we will look at these alternatives and see how they play out in some languages,
e.g., C++, Fortran and Python.

_Short bio:_
_Magne Haveraaen is a professor of programming theory at the Department of informatics, University of Bergen.
He heads the Bergen Language Design Laboratory (BLDL), and was initiator of the Energy Informatics Lab at the department.
He has a vested interest in high performance and large scale computing._

## ELIXIR Goes Green: A Node-Driven Approach to Environmental Sustainability (I. Winge)

ELIXIR is a pan-European research infrastructure empowering researchers by providing a unified platform for databases, software, training, and computing power. It brings together life science resources from across Europe, and has a unique position in influencing the scientific community. ELIXIR is committed to minimizing its own environmental impact and supporting its member nodes in this effort, including sharing best practices, providing resources for environmental assessment, and suggesting actions to mitigate the impact and promote best practices through its stakeholders in Europe.
Recognizing the environmental impact of research, ELIXIR would like to raise awareness of researchers on their environmental footprint and explore methods to assess the impact of their activities. Additionally, ELIXIR encourages data reuse and explores ways to optimize hardware and energy sources for greener research. By addressing these challenges, ELIXIR aims to shape Europe's response to climate change and build a more sustainable future for scientific research.
Our ambition is to map out the challenges in our infrastructure, and give examples from the nodes both when it comes to logistics, but also how to approach green computing.

_This is a joint work with Mariana de Freitas, Francesca De Leo, Giacinto Donvito._
